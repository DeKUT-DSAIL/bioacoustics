### Step 4: Choose the operating system
The Raspberry Pi supports numerous operating systems. It features various editions of Raspberry Pi OS, including 64-bit and 32-bit, as well as Lite, Full, and versions with recommended software. Additionally, operating systems like Ubuntu, Alpine Linux, and RISC OS Pi are accessible through the Raspberry Pi Imager. Your choice of operating system should consider factors like the processing power of your Raspberry Pi model, its intended use, and compatibility with the software. 

To choose the operating system, click the `CHOOSE OS` button. Figure 4 shows the variety of operating systems that the Raspberry Pi can run on.
