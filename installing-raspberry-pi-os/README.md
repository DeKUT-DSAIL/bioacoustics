# Installing Raspberry Pi OS
**NOTE: THESE INSTRUCTIONS WERE PREPARED IN FEBRUARY 2025. THE MATERIALS CONTAINED HERE COULD BE OUT OF DATE. CHECK ON THE OFFICIAL RASPBERRY PI WEBSITE FOR UPDATED INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS IF THE ONES OUTLINED HERE DON'T WORK** 

## Requirements
1. Raspberry Pi zero/2/3/4/5
2. MicroSD card- at least 8 GB
3. MicroSD card reader
4. A computer with internet access

## Steps for Installing Raspberry Pi OS
Follow the following steps to install the Raspberry Pi OS on a microSD card.

### Step 1: Mount the microSD card
Mount the microSD card on a computer that has internet access.

### Step 2: Install Raspberry Pi Imager
Raspberry Pi Imager is a tool for installing Raspberry Pi OS and other operating systems on a microSD card. Download and install the Raspberry Pi Imager (here)[https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/]. Once youâ€™ve installed Imager, launch the application by clicking the Raspberry Pi Imager icon or running rpi-imager on the terminal.

### Step 4: Choose the operating system
The Raspberry Pi supports numerous operating systems. It features various editions of Raspberry Pi OS, including 64-bit and 32-bit, as well as Lite, Full, and versions with recommended software. Additionally, operating systems like Ubuntu, Alpine Linux, and RISC OS Pi are accessible through the Raspberry Pi Imager. Your choice of operating system should consider factors like the processing power of your Raspberry Pi model, its intended use, and compatibility with the software. 

To choose the operating system, click the `CHOOSE OS` button. Figure 4 shows the variety of operating systems that the Raspberry Pi can run on.
